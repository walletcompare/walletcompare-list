AirGap is a wallet solution, allowing the secure generation and storage of secrets on a mobile phone with an approach of two mobile apps. Depending on the security needed these apps can be installed on separate devices or on the same device.

## Primary objective

With AirGap, we would like to create a community driven and secure wallet that can be used by anyone. It should make the complex process of managing an air-gapped setup easy and accessible to everyone. Other than hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano or Trezor, AirGap doesn't utilize special hardware, but rather lets the user choose his own hardware. It can be used on an upcycled or dedicated mobile phones as well as on a notebook or even a Raspberry Pi.

With the AirGap two device
approach, secret-handling becomes more accessible and secure. AirGap covers security on
three layers:
* Advanced secret generation using multiple sources of entropy (e.g. mic, video,
accelerometer, touch)
* Social secret recovery using Shamir's secret sharing.
* AirGap follows a two-device approach, leveraging the mobile application sandbox
and permission system as well as biometrically secured enclaves (Touch ID, Face ID,
Fingerprint).

These three layers cover common attack vectors and misusages concerning secret
management in the context of cryptocurrencies. Even though security and user experience
often result in trade-off decision between one or the other, we’ve spent a lot of effort to
achieve what we call “accessible security”. We believe that security alone is not enough if
crypto adoption should reach the masses, but a solution also needs to be easy and
understandable to use.
